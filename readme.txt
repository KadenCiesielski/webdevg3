         Each menu page now has their own separate dedicated category 
         The menu items now have better organization of menu items with clear sections 
         The navigation is now more intuitive
         I removed the map
         I centered the contact information and gave it a better presentation
         The menu is more organized and has a better presentation
         I made it easier to navigate between the different menu pages

Emily: 
- Navigation bar/header
    - Made navigation bar pinned to the top of the page so it is still visable while scrolling 
    - Hamburger menu for mobile/smaller screen use
    - Changed font to match the italian deli aestetic and cursive used in logo 
    - When hovering color of block is lightened and text is brighter
    - Chose to not have photo header above navigation bar to clean up website appearence and avoid cluttered look on screen when paired with images on pages
- Footer
    - Matches style of the header/navigation bar 
    - Got rid of map layout and made it smaller to take up less of page to be more of a proper footer
    - Still links address to find us page with number linked and links to socials (facebook, instagram, twitter) + reviews (google reviews + yelp)
    - Used social links from orginal website
